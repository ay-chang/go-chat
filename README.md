# Go-Terminal-Chat

A simple terminal-based chat application written in Go, built as a learning project to explore **network programming**, **concurrency**, and **message broadcasting** using core Go features.

This is a basic but functional chat app that allows multiple clients to connect to a server, send messages, and receive messages from others in real time. Over time, I plan to add new features like nicknames, authentication, chat history, and more.

## Features (Current)

- Multi-client TCP server using the `net` package
- Concurrent client handling with goroutines
- Real-time message broadcasting using Go channels
- Basic terminal client that can send and receive messages
- Command support (`/help`, `/msg @user`, `/quit`)
- Client disconnection handling

## Foundational coding techniques used:

### TCP Networking in Go

- Using `net.Listen()` and `net.Dial()` to set up client-server communication
- Managing TCP connections as byte streams

### Goroutines and Concurrency

- Handling multiple clients at once without blocking
- Running background listeners (e.g. receive messages while typing)

### Channels and Message Broadcasting

- Centralizing messages from all clients into a broadcast loop
- Distributing messages out to all connected clients safely

### Safe Shared State

- Using `sync.Mutex` to prevent race conditions when accessing shared resources (like the clients map)

## Planned Features

- Nicknames and user identification
- Colored terminal output per user
- Chat history logging
- Hosting on a public server

## How to Run Locally

### Server

```bash
go mod init go-chat-app
cd server
go run .
```

### Client (in another terminal)

```bash
cd client
go run .
```
